 * Through this project, I wanted to learn how to make a web design layout and components from scratch. I figured out using Gridsome was the best for this project. 
 * Now that it is done, I was able to refresh all my HTML/CSS concepts and skills. With the help of freeCodeCamp.org and earning the responsive web design certifications, I was able to craft this website in less than 2 weeks. 
 
 ### Tech used: 
 * Gridsome
 * HTML/CSS
